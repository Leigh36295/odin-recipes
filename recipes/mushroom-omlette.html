        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
    <li>1 large handful mushrooms (about 80g/3oz), sliced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ground paprika</li>
    <li>1 handful baby spinach</li>
    <li>2 free-range eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recipe steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Cook the mushrooms for 2â€“3 minutes, or until they are golden-brown. Add the paprika and spinach, and stir so the spinach wilts. Remove the vegetables from the pan.</li>
    <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then pour the beaten egg into the pan. Cook, gently drawing in the sides of the omelette with a spatula, allowing the uncooked egg to fill the gaps and set.</li>
    <li>When the omelette is almost cooked, spoon the mushroom and spinach mixture back in, then flip over one half and slide onto a plate.</li>
